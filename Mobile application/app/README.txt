1. This part focuses on data visualisation, management and control tasks for our application. 
    Main efforts were put in designing the background pictures which show all contents of the applictaion. 

2. Black circles are used to highlight the position of buttons, which is not very accurate because of the difficulty in fixing.

3. Also, we try to make a clear version of how users can interact with the pages by clicking different buttons and make a 
process tree to show the logic within them.

4. Four functions have been written to show the interaction with information stored in local database. However, they haven't been embedded into the pages because of the difficulties in positioning.
